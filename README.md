# astrocumbia

I'm a software engineer 👨🏽‍💻. <br/>
The last 4 years I have been working as a mobile developer 📱 in different Startups in Mexico city.
I code in Kotlin, Swift and Dart for mobile development and ruby, elixir and Javascript for backend.
Currently I work remotely from different cities in Mexico.

I like to learn about algorithms, computer science and mathematics.

In my free time i like to bike around the city 🚴🏽‍♂️, learn about music production 🎧 and carpentry 🪑.
